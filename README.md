# mount_gsm


This project was made using arduino and gsm shield.

It gets the temperature readings using an mlx temperature sensor.

If the temperature reading it gets is more than the threshold, it makes of the gsm shield to send a message to a registered number about the high temperature.


It has a wide variety of applications.It can be used to prevent the spike of temperature related diseases by sending  a message to the specified phone number.



Have fun trying it.

Make sure you install the required arduino libraries needed for it to work
