# flutter_led_control


This project was made using arduino and gsm shield.

It gets the temperature readings using an mlx temperature sensor.

If the temperature reading it gets is more than the threshold, it makes of the gsm shield to send a message to a registered number about the high temperature

Have fun trying it.

Make sure you install the required arduino libraries needed for it to work
